,Yeah... About this. I need to take some light back. I'm out of light myself so...,
,I can take you to the queen's castle if you want.,
,...Never mind then. By the way, it is not her castle it's my castle!,
,Well, I'm looking forward to that. But now I'm taking some light back...,
,You can't do this to me!,
